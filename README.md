Chapter 3 and 4 are completed in R. Chapter 5 onwards uses PyMC3 and Stan.

Many thanks to PyMC devs and ssp3nc3r for the translation of the textbook code into [Python + PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking)) and [Stan](https://github.com/ssp3nc3r/rethinking) respectively.
